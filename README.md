# Clean Monitoring System

## Architecture

This monitoring system has been completely rearchitected with clean separation of concerns:

### Core Components

1. **`stock_monitor.py`** - Pure stock monitoring
   - Bulk API calls every 15-25 seconds
   - Returns clean data: `{tcin: {title, in_stock, last_checked}}`
   - No purchase logic, just stock checking

2. **`purchase_manager.py`** - Isolated purchase management
   - Tracks states: `ready`, `attempting`, `purchased`, `failed`
   - Prevents retriggering when already `attempting`
   - Simple timestamp-based completion

3. **`dashboard_app.py`** - Clean Flask orchestrator
   - Combines stock + purchase data
   - Auto-refresh every 15-25 seconds
   - Activity log with purchase success/failure indicators
   - Reuses existing dashboard template (no CSS changes)

## Key Features

- **Clean Architecture**: Separated concerns, ~300 total lines vs 1300+ before
- **Automatic Monitoring**: 15-25 second intervals, independent of purchase state
- **Purchase Prevention**: Won't retrigger while mid-purchase
- **Activity Logging**: Shows purchase success/failure in activity log
- **Same UI**: Kept existing dashboard appearance and functionality

## Usage

```bash
# Run the clean dashboard
python3 dashboard_app.py
```

## What Was Removed

- Complex stealth features and session management
- Overly engineered F5/Shape evasion
- Redundant user agents and cookie rotation
- Mixed responsibilities and tight coupling

## Files Moved to `old_complex_versions/`

- `simple_dashboard.py` (1300+ lines of complexity)
- `simple_dashboard_backup.py`
- `simple_dashboard_fixed.py`
- `foolproof_dashboard.py`
- `foolproof_purchase.py`

The new system accomplishes the same goals with much cleaner, maintainable code.
